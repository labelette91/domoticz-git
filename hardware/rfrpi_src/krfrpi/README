This is a Kernel Driver for receiving data based on kernel interuption instead of
Software interruption this helps to correctly handle timing with RPI B+ and RPI2
where kernel respond to software interrupt with an incertain delay.

To compile this kernel driver you need to have your RPI environment ready for it. 
Please take a look to this post for being ready.

Then to compile, execute
make

After you can load the kernel by insmod krfrpi.ko
You should after that have a /dev/rfrpi device
